/*
INTUTION::
Both the players play optimally. dp[i] = true represents that for i th number, Alice can win. False means Alice loses.
Lets assume Alice loses for n=k.
Thus, if at any point i Alice can remove a square number such that the remaining number is equal to k, and k is false, then Alice can win at the point i.
